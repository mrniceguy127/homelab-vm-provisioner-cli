Getting Started
===============

User Setup
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   ./setup

Common Commands
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   ./vmctl create configs/devbox.yaml
   ./vmctl destroy devbox
   ./vmssh-admin devbox

Developer Setup
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   ./setup --dev
   ./test

``./test`` runs lint, the Python test suite, and coverage.

Project-wide default data paths live in ``vmctl.yaml``.

By default:

- local VM artifacts are written under ``vm/data/<vm>/``
- persisted state is tracked in ``vm/state/<vm>.yaml``
- user public keys are resolved from ``vm/keys/users/``
- generated admin keys are written under ``vm/keys/admin/``
- the guest image defaults to the Debian 12 cloud image with libvirt
  ``os_variant`` set to ``debian12``

Tenant public keys are recommended when available before provisioning, but they
are optional. If ``vm.ssh_key_file`` is omitted, the tenant account is still
created and an administrator can add the key later.

Global image defaults live in ``vmctl.yaml`` under ``image:``, and a VM config
can override them with its own ``image:`` block.

Set ``paths.vm_data_dir`` in a VM config to override the local artifact
directory for one VM.

Run the pieces individually when needed:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./scripts/test
   ./scripts/coverage
   ./scripts/docs-build
